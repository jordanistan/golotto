Imagine you are able to predict the next lotto number to win a life time of money~!
Well this app is what I am trying to do. Now I understand that the lotto is random numbers and I will never find the true answer being 42. 
For those that can imagine; Please keep your arms and feet in side during this ride.  I know it may get exciting but this is just a app trying to figure out the future.
 
Here is how I am going to go at this project.
Having a script/module download up-to-date Winning numbers.
Generate random numbers with the old winning lotto numbers. This is the cross examination between same numbers. 
Have a menu to choose from Mega Millions or Power Ball
Once You have made your choice X value of numbers will be displayed. These are your hopefully winning numbers.

Think Card Counting
Here is my theory behind how this will work. Just like cards, if you know a King has been played there are only 3 kings left. If one of the kings happens to be in your hand. Here you know you have at least one high pair being kings. Lets think the same with a lotto number(s) that have all ready been in use or a winner. The odds of the same combination coming back up are very unlikely; in fact the Mega Millions and Power Ball have never had it happen. 
In a typical 6/49 game, six numbers are drawn from a range of 49 and if the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner this is true no matter in which order the numbers appear. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.

So far we have only seen 1835 combination of winners for the PowerBall and 1359 combinations from Mega Millions. While these numbers are still low we can gather some details from the data to see if there is anything to analyze. One thing I am going to be taking in to considerations is the numbers that show up more then others.  If random , why are numbers showing up more then others? This gives us some advantage in my mind.
